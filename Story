AltruBox Trilogy – AltruBox, AltruMoneta and PoAt
The gift moves between people. The coin moves to a cause. Trust lives on-chain.
________________________________________
0. Short Summary
The AltruBox Trilogy is a decentralized, blockchain-based system connecting:
•	AltruBox – a gift box that is also a micro-foundation:
the gift goes to the person, the coin that opens the box goes to a good cause.
•	AltruMoneta – a physical and digital coin used to open the box and
inevitably fund causes, funds, and public goods.
•	PoAt (Proof of AltruTrust) – a trust certificate born from the
interaction between box and coin, recording on-chain the history of
trust and altruism between people, businesses, and services.
Every act – opening a box, donating, completing a trust-based deal – is
recorded as an on-chain event. Thus invisible trust becomes visible,
portable, and verifiable.

1. The Story – from one bayonet to a trust trilogy
It all starts with something very personal and very simple.
A friend gives you an AK bayonet as a gift.
In your culture, a knife is not given “for free” – it must be “paid for” with a coin,
otherwise it is believed it will “cut” the relationship.
You give him a coin. At that moment, something important happens:
•	the bayonet is no longer just a gift – it becomes a ritual,
•	the coin is no longer just money – it becomes a symbol of respect and balance.
This moment does not fade.	
Over time you:
•	start buying and selling AK bayonets – as special gifts;
•	want the gift to be more than just an object – you want a ritual.
The first box appears:
•	a cardboard box with a coin slot and a simple mechanical lock;
•	inside – the bayonet, presented as a gift;
•	to receive it, the person must insert a coin.
The ritual is simple and magical:
You insert a coin → something “clicks” → the box opens → the gift is yours.
People love it. A simple gift becomes a small ceremony.
Then comes the key question:
•	What if the coin does not stay with the giver or the receiver?
•	What if it always goes to a good cause?
The answer gives birth to the three elements:
1.	AltruBox – the gift box that is also a foundation in a box.
2.	AltruMoneta – the coin that unlocks the gift and funds the cause.
3.	PoAt – the certificate that records all these acts of trust
and makes them portable across time and platforms.
Then comes the natural evolution:
•	from a physical box → to a digital AltruBox;
•	from a physical coin → to a digital AltruMoneta (token);
•	from “I trust you” said verbally → to PoAt, written and visible on-chain.

2. AltruBox – gift + foundation + on-chain event
2.1. What is AltruBox
AltruBox is:
•	a gift box (physical or digital),
•	containing a gift – item, service, access, NFT, code, rights, etc.,
•	linked to a specific cause / fund / “foundation pool”.
The core rule:
The recipient always receives the gift.
The coin used to open the box never goes to the recipient or the sender –
it goes to the cause that the box is bound to.
AltruBox is simultaneously:
1.	A gift box – carrying emotion, gesture, symbol;
2.	A micro-foundation – every opening = real funding of a cause.
2.2. What AltruBox does
•	It connects the personal moment of gifting with a public good.
•	It removes the need:
o	for money to move between friends and relatives,
o	for complex contracts around small donations,
o	for heavy administrative setups behind each micro-cause.
The box itself is a mini-fund with a built-in mechanism:
The gift moves on one line, the money moves on another.
2.3. Physical AltruBox
•	A box with:
o	coin slot,
o	simple mechanical unlocking mechanism.
•	Inside:
o	the gift,
o	description of the cause (card, certificate, QR code).
•	The recipient:
o	inserts a physical coin,
o	the box opens,
o	the coin goes into a separate cash pool reserved for the cause.
2.4. Digital AltruBox on blockchain
In the digital world, AltruBox can be:
•	an NFT or on-chain object, which includes:
o	gift_metadata – what the gift is,
o	cause_address – address of the cause (fund, DAO, multisig),
o	rules – conditions for opening (how much AltruMoneta is required, etc.).
Process:
1.	The recipient wants to open the digital AltruBox.
2.	They send AltruMoneta tokens to the box’s smart contract.
3.	The smart contract:
o	transfers the tokens to cause_address (or locks them into a fund),
o	“unlocks” the gift (reveals content, allows claiming an NFT, etc.),
o	emits on-chain events (BoxOpened, DonationRouted).
All of this is:
•	decentralized (logic lives in smart contracts),
•	traceable (every transaction is on-chain),
•	visible (anyone can inspect box → coin → cause flows).

3. AltruMoneta – intention coin and token for causes
3.1. What is AltruMoneta
AltruMoneta is:
•	a physical and digital coin,
•	used as a key to open AltruBox,
•	and as a carrier of the donation to the cause.
It is not:
•	payment for the gift,
•	a direct financial transaction between the two people,
•	“just another speculative token”.
It is:
“The coin of intention” –
“I want to receive this gift, and on the way I want to support the cause it is tied to.”
3.2. What it does
•	Connects the act of receiving with the act of giving.
•	Ensures every box opening is not only a personal moment, but also
funding for the common good.
•	Creates on-chain traces:
o	which address opened which box,
o	which cause received funds,
o	what volume passed through the system.
3.3. How it works on blockchain
On a technical level:
•	AltruMoneta can be an ERC-20 (or similar) token,
•	or an internal unit in a protocol, as long as it respects one invariant:
When opening an AltruBox, the value of AltruMoneta
never goes to sender or receiver –
it goes to the cause.
Process:
1.	The recipient’s address holds some AltruMoneta.
2.	To open AltruBox:
o	they sign a transaction to the smart contract.
3.	The smart contract:
o	transfers the tokens to cause_address,
o	records events (DonationRouted, BoxOpened),
o	unlocks the gift.
4.	These on-chain events are later used for:
o	statistics and transparency,
o	reports,
o	and most importantly – for PoAt.

4. PoAt – Proof of AltruTrust: the trust certificate
Here is the core focus.
4.1. PoAt emerging from AltruBox–AltruMoneta interaction
Every act:
•	“gift in a box opened via coin to a cause”,
•	trust-based deal,
•	service or help aligned with these principles,
leaves an on-chain trace:
•	address → box → coin → cause → event.
These events are not just accounting – they are proofs of trust and altruism.
PoAt is the system that:
•	reads these on-chain events,
•	aggregates them per identity,
•	turns them into a trust certificate for a specific person, business, or address.
4.2. What is PoAt
PoAt (Proof of AltruTrust) is:
•	a declaration / certificate of trust,
•	based on real actions (not opinions or star ratings),
•	showing:
o	how many times this person/business used AltruBox/AltruMoneta,
o	how often they took risk in deals and fulfilled it,
o	how they handled disputes,
o	to what extent they support causes and communities.
PoAt:
•	can be carried between platforms,
•	can evolve as new events accumulate,
•	can be restricted or penalized if abuses are proven.
4.3. How PoAt works (conceptually)
1.	Event collection
– from smart contracts of AltruBox, AltruMoneta and other integrated systems.
2.	Identity
– each event is linked to an address/identity (DID, ENS, etc.).
3.	Aggregation
– events are grouped per subject and described with:
o	event type, timestamp, context, amount, cause, proof.
4.	Certificate generation
– a PoAt document is formed:
o	overall statistics (number of trust-based deals, total donations, etc.),
o	a list of key events,
o	signatures from platforms/DAO/organizations that attest to them.
5.	Verification and usage
– another person, business or platform can:
o	see the PoAt certificate,
o	validate signatures and on-chain data,
o	decide how much to trust this subject.

5. PoAt and analogies: HTTPS and Hawala
5.1. PoAt and HTTPS
HTTPS certificates:
•	prove that a website is authentic and the connection is encrypted;
•	we trust that there is a legitimate server/organization behind the domain.
PoAt:
•	proves that a person or small business has a consistent history
of honest behavior and altruism;
•	signals:
“This entity has repeatedly behaved in a trustworthy way in deals and causes.”
Similarities:
•	both are trust certificates,
•	both have:
o	structured data,
o	issuers,
o	verifiable cryptographic proofs.
Difference in focus:
•	HTTPS → trust in a server/site (technical security).
•	PoAt → trust in a person/business (social and economic behavior).
In short:
HTTPS says: “This site is real and the connection is secure.”
PoAt says: “This person/business has repeatedly proven to be reliable and altruistic.”
5.2. PoAt and Hawala
Hawala:
•	ancient value transfer system,
•	works through a network of trusted intermediaries,
•	almost no formal documentation,
•	runs purely on reputation, honor, and word.
PoAt:
•	also works with reputation and trust,
•	but instead of staying in the shadows,
PoAt structures and lights up:
o	who did what,
o	which platforms/communities confirmed it,
o	what history is being built.
Metaphorically:
Hawala is the “underground bank of honor.”
PoAt is the “transparent, above-ground ledger of trust.”

6. Is there an analogue? Why is it needed and for whom?
We have many partial pieces:
•	Credit scores – focus only on money/debt, not altruism and trust-based behavior.
•	Star ratings and reviews – locked into platforms, easy to game,
limited to one ecosystem.
•	Web of Trust, SSI, soulbound tokens – for keys, identities and merits
in specific ecosystems.
But there is no universal, open, decentralized certificate for trust and altruism,
focused on:
•	micro-deals,
•	small services,
•	causes,
•	real everyday human interactions.
Who PoAt is for:
•	Private individuals – for peer-to-peer deals and exchanges.
•	Freelancers and small businesses – for working with unknown clients.
•	Workshops, repair shops, local stores, micro e-commerce –
to build portable reputation beyond a single platform.
•	Communities and cooperatives – for mutual aid, sharing economy, DAO models.
•	Platforms and marketplaces – as an additional trust layer.

7. Future uses of PoAt – deals between people, small companies and strangers online
7.1. Deals between private individuals
Examples:
•	selling a phone to a stranger,
•	sending a parcel while taking risk,
•	buying something from a person you see for the first time online.
With PoAt:
•	before taking risk, parties can “look each other up” using PoAt.
•	Platforms can:
o	offer different conditions depending on PoAt level
(escrow, cash-on-delivery, prepay/postpay).
Result:
Less fraud, less fear, more honest deals.
7.2. Small businesses, services, craftsmen, repair shops
Local repair shops, craftsmen, tailors, hairdressers, small online shops:
•	with PoAt, can show:
o	a real count of successfully completed services and deals,
o	how disputes were handled,
o	what causes they support via AltruBox/AltruMoneta.
Clients no longer look only at “one or two bad reviews”,
but at overall behavior over time.
7.3. Online purchases/sales with strangers
Marketplaces and e-commerce platforms:
•	can use PoAt to:
o	onboard new sellers with better conditions if they have strong PoAt,
o	offer credit/payment options to buyers with positive PoAt history.
PoAt becomes a “passport of trust” for global online markets.
7.4. Rentals – housing, cars, equipment, shared economy
For rentals of:
•	apartments, rooms,
•	cars, bikes, scooters,
•	equipment, tools, studios,
PoAt allows:
•	dynamic deposits – lower for reliable people,
•	recording events in case of problems – which affects future conditions.
Trust becomes cheaper for the trustworthy and more expensive for the risky.
7.5. B2B between small companies
Small companies in different cities/countries:
•	can use PoAt to decide:
o	whether to offer deferred payment,
o	whether to ship goods on trust,
o	how to structure terms.
PoAt complements classic “credit checks” with human behavior data.

8. Summary – why PoAt is the focus
In the trilogy:
•	AltruBox gives shape to the gesture (gift + cause).
•	AltruMoneta gives direction to value (toward cause, not between people).
•	PoAt gives memory to trust (a story that lives on the blockchain).
The long-term focus is PoAt, because:
•	the box and the coin are the “stage and props”,
•	PoAt is the script that remains written after every act.
This story:
•	is decentralized (no single owner),
•	open and verifiable (on blockchain),
•	portable across platforms and contexts,
•	and is built around one simple but powerful idea:
The gift is between us.
The coin is for the world.
The trust – for everyone, recorded forever.
